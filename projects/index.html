            This project is a Flask-based website for the IOIT ACM Student
            Chapter. It uses Flask for the backend, TailwindCSS for styling, and
            ThreeJS and WebGL for 3D graphics. I managed the web hosting over
            CPanel, a web hosting control panel that helps users manage their
            websites and web hosting servers. During my time as the webmaster at
            IOIT ACM, I was responsible for web hosting and server management
            using cPanel, ensuring smooth deployment and reliable operation of
            the website.
