            Quick-Flask is a command-line tool that helps developers rapidly
            generate Flask applications with a structured project layout. It
            simplifies boilerplate creation by setting up routes, templates,
            static files, and configurations automatically. Ideal for beginners
            and experienced developers, Quick-Flask accelerates Flask project
            setup, allowing you to focus on building features rather than
            repetitive setup tasks, adhering to the DRY (Don't' Repeat Yourself)
            principle.
