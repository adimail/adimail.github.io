                    <div class="desc">
                        I find reinforcement learning fascinating, so I built this simulation where an agent learns to land a booster vertically. It uses a custom physics engine (including Verlet integration) to model key factors like thrust, gravity, rotation, and air resistance. I added a live visualizer so I can watch the agent refine its landing technique â€“ tweaking throttle and cold gas thrusters â€“ as it trains. I set up a Gymnasium environment, used Stable-Baselines3 for the PPO agent, and built a simple web interface to visualize the attempts.

                        I wanted to build a Jupyter Notebook clone my way, so I made one from scratch! It handles directory browsing, notebook editing, code execution, and rich outputs like images, HTML, and errors. I did not use jupyter_server and jupyter_client (which gives a lot of functionalities out of the box) because I wanted to implement the logic on my own. The only jupyter package I used was nbformat (It handles the serialization and deserialization of .ipynb files) because dealing with .ipynb files manually is a pain. Some new technologies I got to work on while working on this project includes Tornado webservers for async io, ZeroMQ, WebSockets, IPython, and Webpack for typescript. I read on the internet that many data scientist and security researchers use Jupiter notebooks in their daily life. I also noticed that companies like databricks have their own notebook platforms. So I wanted to build this from scratch to see how big tech uses this technology.

                        Quick-Flask is a command-line tool that helps developers rapidly
                        generate Flask applications with a structured project layout. It
                        simplifies boilerplate creation by setting up routes, templates,
                        static files, and configurations automatically. Ideal for beginners
                        and experienced developers, Quick-Flask accelerates Flask project
                        setup, allowing you to focus on building features rather than
                        repetitive setup tasks, adhering to the DRY (Don't' Repeat Yourself)
                        principle.
