            Feb 2025 | Linear Programming, Artificial Intelligence, PuLP,
            XGBoost, Optimisation Algorithms
          </p>
          <div class="desc">
            Developed a machine learning solution to optimize fantasy sports
            team selection by building a web scraper to collect player data from
            ESPN and designing an AI-driven algorithm using XGBoost and PuLP.
            Integrated player form analysis and multi-objective optimization to
            balance constraints (budget, roles) while maximizing points,
            enabling efficient team selection. Implemented MLOps pipelines for
            scalability, leveraging Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to deliver
            a robust, data-driven decision-making tool.

          <div class="desc">
            Developed an educational search engine that spits out neatly
            organized responses to user queries, making it easier for everyone
            to learn. When someone searches, the engine creates a custom summary
            based on their age and education level, highlighting the most
            important points. We use past search data along with user details to
            fine-tune these responses, which also feed into our book and study
            material recommendation system powered by a TfidfVectorizer ML
            algorithm. I moderated the project by keeping our four-member teamâ€™s
            worktree in top shape, managing devops operations, and working on
            both the backend and the UI. For more details, please visit the link
            above.

            Feb 2025 | Flask, TensorFlow, Computer Vision, Real-Time Analytics,
            SQLite
          </p>
          <div class="desc">
            Developed a security surveillance platform leveraging CCTV networks
            and a custom ML model with attention layers for real-time fight
            detection. Integrated live video feeds, historical anomaly logging,
            and interactive analytics using Chart.js. Implemented role-based
            access control, voice/text broadcasts, and rate-limiting via
            Flask-Limiter. Designed a modular architecture with Flask blueprints
            and SQLite for scalable data management. Features include
            browser-based voice alerts, anomaly trend visualization, and
            automated data-clearing scripts, providing a comprehensive solution
            for public safety monitoring.
