                        This project started at the Hackbyte 3.0 MLH hackathon in Jabalpur, where I teamed up with a senior engineer. We looked into Azure IoT Hub's aggressive pricing and decided to put together this self-hosted framework using a Go simulator and Python processes to handle telemetry at the edge, dramatically cutting costs. Our calculations revealed 20x const savings.

                        metadata visualization and management tool for lakehouse tables, enabling users to explore schema evolution, track partition changes, and query metadata without relying on an external metastore. Our platform integrates automated smart crawlers, a visual DAG explorer, and a self-service data catalog to streamline metadata analysis. With support for multiple table formats and scalable processing via Trino, our tool enhances decision-making and accelerates metadata-driven insights.

                        Developed a machine learning solution to optimize fantasy sports
                        team selection by building a web scraper to collect player data from
                        ESPN and designing an AI-driven algorithm using XGBoost and PuLP.
                        Integrated player form analysis and multi-objective optimization to
                        balance constraints (budget, roles) while maximizing points,
                        enabling efficient team selection. Implemented MLOps pipelines for
                        scalability, leveraging Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to deliver
                        a robust, data-driven decision-making tool.

                        Developed an educational search engine that spits out neatly
                        organized responses to user queries, making it easier for everyone
                        to learn. When someone searches, the engine creates a custom summary
                        based on their age and education level, highlighting the most
                        important points. We use past search data along with user details to
                        fine-tune these responses, which also feed into our book and study
                        material recommendation system powered by a TfidfVectorizer ML
                        algorithm. I moderated the project by keeping our four-member teamâ€™s
                        worktree in top shape, managing devops operations, and working on
                        both the backend and the UI. For more details, please visit the link
