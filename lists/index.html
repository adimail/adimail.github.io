      <h2>NPTEL</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently in my undergraduate course in AI&DS, and we don't have a
        Theory of Computation (TOC) subject. My interest in the topic grew after
        one of our faculty members mentioned it in a lecture.

      <h2>Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Most engineers are seen as highly intelligent and start working with
        machines early in life. I didn't have an extraordinary start in
        engineering. I got into it because I wanted to use computers for games
        and movies. Over time, I learned to love them, discovering that computer
        science connects to many other fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engineering is a creative process that involves finding a balance
        between consuming knowledge and creating new things. Which I happen to
        understand is not easily teachable, and it's based on years of
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting with a simple "hello world" level is better than trying to do
        everything at once. I focused on getting basic functionality working
        first.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value courage in engineering. It's the willingness to tackle difficult
        problems, walk into unfamiliar code, and search for answers. Courage is
        about shifting from "impossible" to "figureoutable."
      </p>
      <p>
        I love experimenting with things. Computers were part of my life since I
        could walk and I was sort of a computer geek in my school days but I was
        formally introduced to computer programming in my first year of college.
        C++ was my first language.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have created a
        <a href="https://adimail.github.io/classroom/">blog</a> site which I
        used to take notes sometimes in my college.
