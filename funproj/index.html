            PDFTools is a collection of Python utilities designed for PDF
            automation. It includes scripts for grayscale and color inversion
            for PDF files. This project aims to provide simple tools for working
            with PDFs and can be extended to include other automation tasks in
            the future. I love ILovePDF, but I noticed there are some tasks that
            certain software can’t handle, which require a more hands-on
            approach. My sister needed to print some lecture notes, but the
            teacher had provided them with notes that had a black background,
            and the printer refused to print them, saying it would look bad. She
            asked me for help, and I knew I could first convert the PDF to
            grayscale and then invert the colors (black to white, white to
            black) to make the text readable. The online tools I found were too
            slow, and they uploaded the files to a server, which I didn’t like.
            I don’t understand why online PDF and multimedia tools don’t use
            technologies like WASM to handle operations on the client side. So,
            I wrote these simple scripts to accomplish this task, and my sister
            was happy with the results. I will be adding more scripts as needed.
            Perhaps I will move this to my serious list soon.

            This Perl script minifies JavaScript and CSS files by removing
            comments, unnecessary whitespace, and optimizing values. It can be
            used in one-time mode or in watch mode, where it automatically
            processes files whenever they are modified. The script also supports
            custom configuration for input and output directories.

            Sisyphus is a minimal, terminal-based to-do list app built with the
            Go programming language. It uses the gocui library for building user
            interfaces in the terminal (used by lazygit as well). The app helps
            you manage tasks in a simple, efficient way from the command line.

            I didn't do well in my computer networks exam, so I decided to build
            a DNS resolver to learn more. I created a DNS resolver in Go. The
            resolver handles DNS queries, checks its cache, and queries upstream
            servers for records like A and CNAME.

            a mobile game developed in Flutter. It allows users to play a
            guessing game where they hold their phone to their forehead and
            receive clues from friends. The game is built using Flutter and the
            sensors_plus Dart package to handle the phone's accelerometer for
            game mechanics.
